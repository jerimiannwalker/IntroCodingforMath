  <title>More on Lists</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
Lists come up a lot in mathematical programming. There is still a little more we will need
to know about them before we can use them effectively. In this section, we will look at using
the length of a list, adding to a list, and creating lists.
  </p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="length-of-a-list">
  <title>Length of a List</title>
  <p>
    The function len() gives the length of a list, which is how many elements the list contains.
    You may recall that we would look at how many items were in a list in order to determine
    how long to make a for loop run. Instead you can use len() to determine the stopping
    point of a loop. The code below shows you the basic concept of the function len().
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
print(len(myList))   #prints 5 because there are 5 items in myList
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>  
  <p>
    Now consider what we were talking about: doing something with a list using a for loop
    and the lists length. Let's take each element of a list, divide it by 3, round the result
    to two decimal places, and print it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>   
        theList = [100,20,1,5,33]
        for i in range(len(theList)):          #for every index in the list
            result = round(theList[i] / 3, 2)  #divide the element at that index by 3 and round it
            print(result)                      #print the result
            </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
    We could have used range(5) instead of range(len(theList)) since we know the list has 5
    elements. However, using len() makes our code more flexible. If we later change the
    list to have more or fewer elements, we won't have to change the for loop. Think about this:
    we might not even be sure about the length of a list when we write the code. That may seem 
    strange, but we could have very large lists or lists that change depending on
    some other aspect of the code. The len() function allows us to write code that will still
    "hit" every element of the list we want.

<subsection xml:id="adding-elements-to-a-list">
    <title>Adding Elements to a List</title>
    <p>
        The append() function allows us to add elements to the end of a list. This is useful
        when we want to build a list as we go, rather than creating it all at once. Let's
        look at a simple example to see how this works.
    </p>
    <p>
        <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
        <input>
theList = [1,2]
theList.append(3)   #adds 3 to the end of theList
theList.append(4)   #adds 4 to the end of theList
print(theList)      #prints [1,2,3,4]
        </input>
        </program>
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that we needed a list to start with in order to use append(). We will not
        always know what is in the list ahead of time. This comes up when you are building a
        list based on some calculations or other code. In order to append the elements to the
        list, we will need to first create an empty list. This is written as "myList = []."
    </p>
    <p>
        <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
        <input>
myList = []          #create an empty list
for i in range(5):   #for every number from 0 to 4
    myList.append(i) #add that number to the end of myList
print(myList)       #prints [0,1,2,3,4]
        </input>
        </program>
    </p>
    <p>
        Something that will come up later is a list of lists. This is when each element of a 
        list is itself a list. When we work with matrices, we will use a list of  lists
        to represent the rows and columns.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Create a list of three states that start with the letter "A" using the append() 
            function. Print your list.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This does not require a for loop. You can start with an empty list and append.
          <program language="python"> 
              <input>
states = []
states.append("Alabama")
states.append("Alaska")
states.append("Arizona")
print(states)

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-2-more-on-lists" difficulty="medium">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Create a list of the first 10 multiples of 4 using a for loop and the append()
        function. Print your list.
        </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Do not just type out the multiples of 4. Calculate them
                using a for loop that goes from 1 to 10 and multiplies each number by 4.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, create an empty list. Then, create a for loop that goes from 1 to 10.
                Inside the loop, calculate the multiple of 4 and append it to the list.
            <program language="python">
                <input>
multiplesOf4 = []
for i in range(1,11):
    multiplesOf4.append(i * 4)
print(multiplesOf4)  #prints [4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40]
                </input>
            </program>  

            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that you can do the calculation inside of the append() function. This
                makes it so no extra variables are needed.

            <p>
                Create a list of the cubes of the first 5 even numbers (2,4,6,8,10) using a for loop
                and the append() function. Print your list.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p> 
                You can use range() to get the first 5 even numbers by multiplying each number
                in the range by 2. Then, cube that result and append it to the list.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You may want to use a variable here to hold the even number
                before cubing it and appending it to the list. This would be in 
                the for loop. Something like: even = 2 * i.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, create an empty list. Then, create a for loop that goes from 1 to 5.
                Inside the loop, calculate the even number, cube it, and append it to the list.
            <program language="python">
                <input>
cubesOfEvens = []
for i in range(1,6):
    even = 2 * i
    cubesOfEvens.append(even ** 3)
print(cubesOfEvens)  #prints [8,64,216,512,1000]
                </input>
