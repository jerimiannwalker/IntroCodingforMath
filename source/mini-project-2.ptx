  <introduction>
    <p>
        For this mini project, you will be finding all <i>perfect</i> cubes of numbers
        in a list. You will then create a new list of only these perfect cubes. A perfect cube
        is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. For example, 27 is a perfect cube
        because it can be expressed as 3^3 (3 * 3 * 3 = 27). On the other hand, 20 is not a perfect cube
        because there is no integer that can be cubed to get 20.

    <statement>
  <p>
    The list of numbers you will be working with is below. You can copy and paste this
    list into your code to get started.
  </p>
  <p>
    numbers = [8, 81, 10, 27, 64, 15, 125, 7, 216, 5, 343, 12]
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that you will need to create a new list. Do that first. Afterwards, you will need
    to loop through each number if the list and check if it is a perfect cube. This means that
    when you take the cube root, the result will be an integer. An integer is a whole number,
    positive or negative, including zero.</p>
    <p>
        You will likely find the function isinstance(value, int) helpful. This function checks
        if "value" is an integer. It will return True if it is. In an if statement, you can
        check if the value is true before adding the number to your new list.

       The correct list of perfect cubes is [8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]. Here is one way to
       write the code to get that answer:
    </p>
    <p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
            numbers = [8, 81, 10, 27, 64, 15, 125, 7, 216, 5, 343, 12]
            perfectCubes = []  #create an empty list to store perfect cubes

            for number in numbers:
                cubeRoot = number ** (1/3)  #calculate the cube root
                if isinstance(cubeRoot, int):  #check if the cube root is an integer
                    perfectCubes.append(number)  #if so, add the number to the perfectCubes list
            
            print(perfectCubes)  #print the list of perfect cubes
            </input>
        </program>
    </p>
