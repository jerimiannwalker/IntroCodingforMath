  <title>If Statements</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
    One of the most basic things in programming is the if statement. This is a block of code
    that runs "if" something is true. This could be a mathematical statement like "if x is bigger
    than 5" or it would be something like "if the list contains apples." If the condition is 
    false, the code simply doesn't run. We will learn how to use if statements in this section.

    <title>Checking Equality</title>
    <p>
        So far, we have been using the equals sign (=) to set a variable to a value. But, to check
        if two things are equal in python, we use a double equals sign (==). This is common in many
        programming languages.
    </p>
      <p>
        Below, we set the value of x to be 5. Then we check if x is equal to 5. If it is,
        we add 1 to x. Finally, we print the value of x. Python uses indentation to show
        what code is inside the if statement. The line that is indented after the if statement
        is the only line that will run if the condition is true.
      </p>
      <p>
  <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>

   x = 5      
   if x == 5:   #check if x is equal to 5
       x = x + 1   #if so, add 1 to x
   print(x)    

    </input>
  </program>
 </p>
 <p>
    What if instead we checked if x was equal to 7? Let's adjust the code and see what happens.
 </p>
 <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
    x = 5
    if x == 7:   #check if x is equal to 7
        x = x + 1   #if so, add 1 to x
    print(x)
    </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
This time, the statement we were checking was false, so the code indented after the if statement
did not run. The values of x is still 5. We did not add 1 to it.
 </p>
 </subsection>
 <subsection xml:id="checking-inequality">
    <title>Checking Inequality</title>
    <p>
        It is also possible to check if two things are not equal. This is done with the 
        "not equal" operator (!=). Let's check if x is not equal to 7, and then add 1 if that
        is the case.
    </p>
    <p>    
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
    x = 5
    if x != 7:   #check if x is not equal to 7
        x = x + 1   #if so, add 1 to x
    print(x)
    </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
Since x is not 7, the code ran and added 1 to x. The value of x is now 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you read inequality, you probably thought about "greater than" or "less than or equal."
        Those are also possible in if statements. The symbols you would use are:
        <ul>
            <li>Greater than: &gt;</li>
            <li>Less than: &lt;</li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: &gt;=</li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: &lt;=</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the code below, we check if x is less than or equal to 10. If it is, we
        multiply x by 2. 
    </p>
    <p>    
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
    x = 3
    if x &lt;=10:   #check if x is less than or equal to 10
        x = x*2   #if so, multiply x by 2
    print(x)
    </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
    If x were 15, the code above would not have multiplied x by 2, and the value of x would have 
    stayed 15.
</p>

    <subsection xml:id="else-statements">
    <title>Else Statements</title>
        <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
        x = 2
        if x &gt; 5:   #check if x is greater than 5
            x = x + 10   #if so, add 10 to x
        else:
            x = x * 4   #if not, multiply x by 4
        print(x)
    </input>
    </program>
    </p>
    <p> 
        Since x is not greater than 5, the if condition is false, and we do not add 10 to x.
        But, since if was false, the else statement runs, and x is multiplied by 4.
        The value of x is now 8.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Set a variable n equal to 20. Check if n is less than 100, and if it is,
                add 50 to n. Finally, print n. What is the value of n?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The value of n is 70 because 20 is less than 100, so we added 50 to it.
            </p>
            <program language="python">
                <input>
n = 20
if n &lt; 100:
    n = n + 50
print(n)

        <statement>
            <p>
                Set a variable k equal to 95. Check if k is greater than or equal to 100. 
                If it is, subtract 20 from k. Otherwise, subtract 5 from k. Finally, print k. 
                What is the value of k?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You will need to use an else statement.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <code>
k = 95
if k &gt;= 100:
    k = k - 20
else:
    k = k - 5
print(k)
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                The value of k is 90 because 95 is not greater than or equal to 100, so the if
                statement does not run. Instead, the else statement is applied. So, 5 is
                subtracted from k.

                Set a variable equal to 6, check if it is less than 12, and if it is, 
                take it to the power of 3. What is the value of your variable?

        </statement>

                You will need to name your variable first.

                Remember that to take something to a power in python, you use **.

            <p>
                We will call our variable a. You could name it something else if you want.

a = 6
if a &lt; 12:
