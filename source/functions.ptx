  <title>Functions</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
A function takes an input (or none or many inputs) and <i>returns</i> an output.
This is useful to organize code and make reuseable code. In this section, we
will write some functions and see how they work!
  </p>

  <title>A Function with Boolean Output</title>
  <p>
    A boolean variable in python is a variable that takes on the value True or
    False only. Not a number, not a string, but a truth value. You can use
    this in if statements to perform actions depending on the truth value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine you are writing code and find that you frequently need to check
    if a number is a multiple of 5. This is the perfect situation to use a function!
    A function is defined in the following way.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
        def functionName(input1,input2,input3):
          function code
          return output
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    The keywords are "def" to define the function and "return" for the output.
    You can call a function whatever you want, as long as it is not a name used
    by python for something else. Let's name our function and the inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
        def mulitpleOfFive(number):
          code we will write
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    To check if we have a multiple of 5, we will see if there is a remainder
    when the number is divided by 5. Recall from the mini projects that % will
    tell you the value of the remainder. So we want a remainder of 0 when the
    number is divided by 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
        def multipleOfFive(number):
          if number%5==0:
            return True
          else:
            return False
      </input>
    </program>  
  </p>
  <p>
    That's it! That is our function! It will return True is the number we put
    in is a multiple of 5 and false oherwise. It does not print anything, so the 
    following code will not show anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
        def multipleOfFive(number):
          if number%5==0:
            return True
          else:
            return False
        
        multipleOfFive(10)
      </input>
    </program>  
  </p>
  <p>
    But, we could put a print statement around it to see the truth value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
        def multipleOfFive(number):
          if number%5==0:
            return True
          else:
            return False
        
        print(multipleOfFive(10))
      </input>
    </program>  
  </p>
  <p>
    We could also use it in an if statement since it returns true or false. Suppose
    that if a number is a multiple of 5 that we want to add 2 to it. Then, we could
    write:
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
        def multipleOfFive(number):
          if number%5==0:
            return True
          else:
            return False
        
        number = 10

        if multipleOfFive(number):
          number = number + 2
          print(number)
      </input>
    </program>  
  </p>

  <title>Quadratic Formula Function</title>
  <p>
    In chapter 1, you wrote code to solve one quadratic equation. In fact, you
    found only one real root of that equation. It is quite a bit to type to
    even find one root. That is the type of code that is useful to write as a function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that the solutions to a quadratic equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> are:
    <m>x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</m>
    The roots are real numbers as long as we take the square root of positive numbers.
    If <m>b^2-4ac &lt; 0</m>, then we are taking the square root of a negative and the
    roots will be complex numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's say we just want real roots. Our function should test for real roots first.
    It is common to return something like "False" when the case does not work. That is what 
    we will do here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
        def realQuadraticSolutions(a,b,c):
          if (b**2 - 4*a*c) &lt; 0:
            return False 
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the <m>\pm</m>, there are two roots. We will find each of these and then
    return a list of roots. So, we will need to define a list, find the roots, and then
    append them to the list. Finally, we will return the list. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
        def realQuadraticSolutions(a,b,c):
          if (b**2 - 4*a*c) &lt; 0:
            return False
          else:
            roots = [] #define the list
            root1 = (-1*b + (b**2-4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the plus root
            root2 = (-1*b - (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the minus root
            roots.append(round(root1,2)) #round to 2 decimals and append to list
            roots.append(round(root2,2)) #same
          return roots
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's test our function out. What if we had <m>2x^2 + 5x - 1 = 0</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
        def realQuadraticSolutions(a,b,c):
          if (b**2 - 4*a*c) &lt; 0:
            return False
          else:
            roots = [] #define the list
            root1 = (-1*b + (b**2-4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the plus root
            root2 = (-1*b - (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the minus root
            roots.append(root1) #append to list
            roots.append(root2) #append to list
          return roots

        #testing
        print(realQuadraticSolutions(2,5,-1))   
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
<p>
  There are many ways to improve this function. For example, if someone types 0 for a,
  we will have issues since we are dividing by a. You could put an error message in, or
  comment your code that a can't be zero. We should also test that it correctly
  returns False when there are no real roots.
</p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
        def realQuadraticSolutions(a,b,c):
          if (b**2 - 4*a*c) &lt; 0:
            return False
          else:
            roots = [] #define the list
            root1 = (-1*b + (b**2-4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the plus root
            root2 = (-1*b - (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5)/2*a #the minus root
            roots.append(root1) #append to list
            roots.append(root2) #append to list
          return roots

        #testing
        print(realQuadraticSolutions(1,1,2))   
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, we correctly get False when there are no real roots.
