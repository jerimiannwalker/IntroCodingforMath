  <title>While Loops</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
A while loop runs "while" something is true. As long as the condition is true, it will
keep repeating the code. This can be dangerous though! If the rule is never false, the loop
will never end. We must be careful to make sure that our rule will eventually be false.

  <title>Example of a While Loop</title>
  <p>
    Let's look at an example of a while loop. In this example, we will start with a variable
    set to 1, and we will keep doubling it while it is less than 100.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
x = 1
while x &lt; 100:   #while x is less than 100
    x = x * 2      #double the value of x
print(x)
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
<p>
    In this code, the value of x is first set to be 1. Then, the while loop checks to see if
    x is less than 100. Since it is, it multiplies x by 2, and the value of x is 2. Then, the
    while loop checks again to see if x is less than 100. It is, so it doubles x again, and x
    is now 4. This continues to where x is 8, 16, 32, 64, and then finally 128. Then, when
    the while loop checks to see if x is less than 100, it finds that it is not, so it stops. It 
    then prints the value of x, which is 128.
