  <title>Basic Operations with Python</title>
  In this section, we will be learning about things like adding and subtracting in python. You
  will see "variables" or things that can take on any value. In python, you set the value of a 
  variable with an equals sign. You can change the value by resetting it. This will make
  more sense once you run the code examples below.

    <title>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division</title>
  <p>
Python will do basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division. In the following example we create a variable x,
set its value to be 1, and then change its value using various operations. Comments
in code start with a "#" and are ignored when the code is run. This allows us to let 
others know what we are doing. 

  </p>
    <p>
      Run the following code. The print command will tell you the value of x after all the
operations. Try to figure out what x will be before running the code!
    </p>
  <p>
  <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
      
  <code>
    x = 1       #set the value of x to 1
    x = x + 1   #add 1 to x
    x = x*2     #multiply x by 2
    x = x - 5   #subtract 5 from x
    print(x)    #print x
  </code>

    </input>
  </program>
  <tests>
</tests>
 </p>
<p>
  Notice that we did not divide. There are two ways to divide in python. For now, we
  will concern ourselves with standard division. But if we take an integer and divide,
  a "float" or decimal number will be returned. This is not important now, but will be later.
</p>
<p>
  <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
      
  <code>
    x = 4       #set the value of x to 4
    x = x/2     #divide x by 2 - will return a float
    print(x)    #print x
  </code>
    </input>
  </program>
  <tests>
</tests>

  <title>Powers and Roots</title>
  <p>
    You may be used to typing an exponent as something like 4^2 = 16. In python, we write this
    as 4**2. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <program codelens="no" language="python" interactive="activecode">
      <input>
      <code>
        x = 4
        x = x**2    #square x
        print(x)
      </code>
    </input>
    </program>  
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall from mathematics that roots can be represented by powers. 
    <md>x^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x}</md>
