  <title>Functions and Libraries</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
        In python, functions allow us to group together and reuse code. They
        have inputs and outputs just like mathematical functions. Libraries are collections
        of functions for a specific task, like the math library, which contains
        functions for things like roots. You will learn how to write and use your own
        functions as well as how to take advantage of libraries in this chapter.
