  <introduction>
    <p> This book is designed for those with some knowledge of mathematics that want
      to learn how to use python to do and explore math. It assumes no coding knowledge. 
    As you work through the book, there are coding exercises. You can install python on your
  local machine or use google colab: https://colab.google/ to complete these. Please feel free
to contact me with any questions at walkerj95@morainevalley.edu.</p>
