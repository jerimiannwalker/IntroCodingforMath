        Here, you will create a list of numbers 0,50 and then create two new lists: one of 
        the even numbers and one of the odd numbers. This will give you practice in creating lists,
        but also it will give you practice in using the "modulus" operator (%). The modulus operator
        gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 7 % 2 is 1 because
        when you divide 7 by 2, the remainder is 1. On the other hand, 8 % 2 is 0 because when you divide
        8 by 2, there is no remainder. You can use this operator to check if a number is even or odd. If
        a number % 2 is 0, then the number is even. If a number % 2 is 1, then the number is odd.

    You will be using lists and the modulus operator. The modulus operator works as below:
    <program language="python">
        <input>
        #check if even
        myList = [1,2]
        for number in myList:
            if number % 2 == 0:
                print(number, "is even.") #prints the number if it is even
        </input>
        </program>
  </p>
    <p>
    This time, you will need to create two new lists. One for evens and one for odds. These
    are the two lists you will print out at the end.
  </p>

    <p>
        First create the list of numbers from 0 to 50. Then, create two empty lists
        to store the even and odd numbers. Next, loop through each number in the list
        of numbers. Use an if statement to check if the number is even or odd using
        the modulus operator. If the number is even, add it to the even numbers list.
        If the number is odd, add it to the odd numbers list. Finally, print out
        both lists.
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
        An else statement is helpful here since a number is either even or odd. So, you
        can use two if statements  -  one for even and one for odd  -  or you can use the 
        else statement after checking for even.
    </p>
    <p>
        <program>
            <input>
            numbers = list(range(51))  #create a list of numbers from 0 to 50
            evenNumbers = []  #create an empty list for even numbers
            oddNumbers = []   #create an empty list for odd numbers

            for number in numbers:
                if number % 2 == 0:  #check if the number is even
                    evenNumbers.append(number)  #add to even numbers list
                else:
                    oddNumbers.append(number)   #add to odd numbers list

            print("Even Numbers:", evenNumbers)  #print the list of even numbers
            print("Odd Numbers:", oddNumbers)    #print the list of odd numbers
            </input>
            </program>
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice in the print statement, there is "Even numbers:" before the list. You can
        print multiple things with a comma separating them. If the thing you are printing
        is a string (like "Even numbers:"), make sure to put it in quotes. Strings are sequences
        of letters, numbers, or symbols that are treated as text by python.
