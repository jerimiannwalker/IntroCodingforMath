  <title>For Loops</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
For loops repeat a block of code a set number of times. This is useful when we know ahead
of time how many times we want to repeat something. For loops are often used with
lists and ranges.

  <title>Lists</title>
  <p>
    A list is a collection of thing, in a specific order. In python, we can create lists using
    square brackets, with commas between each item in the list. The following are each lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program lamguage="python">
      <input>
    <code>
      myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
    </code>
  </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    <program lamguage="python">
      <input>
    <code>
      people = [Abdul, Maria, Joseph]
    </code>
    </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    
  For loops allow us to go through each item in a list, one at a time. One way to do this
  is to name the elements of the list and use the word "in."
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
for number in myList:  #for every number in the list myList
    print(number)       #print the number
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    This code runs through each item in "myList" and prints it one at a time. This is different
    than printing the whole list at once. As you can see below, just printing "myList" gives
    the entire list as one output.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
print(myList)   #print the whole list at once
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  </subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ranges">
  <title>Ranges</title>
  <p>
The range function in python creates a list of numbers, in order, starting from 0 and going up to
one less than the number you give it. For example, the code below creates a list of numbers
from 0 up to 9. Notice we have to add a "list" function around the range function.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myRange = list(range(10))   #create a list from 0 to 9
print(myRange)        #print the list
      </input>
    </program>    
  </p>
  <p>
    You can start a range from any value by giving it two numbers. The first number
    is where the list will start, and the second number is where it will stop - remembering
    it will stop one before that number.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myRange = list(range(5,15))   #create a list from 5 to 14
print(myRange)          #print the list
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
<p>
Ranges combined with for loops allow us to repeat a block of code a set number of times. Imagine
if we wanted to take a variable "number," and add 5 to it ten times. We can do this using a range
with a for loop. Since we are not making a list, we do not need to use the list function.
</p>
<p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
number = 0
for i in range(10):       #repeat the following block 10 times
    number = number + 5   #add 5 to number
print(number)
      </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
  The variable i is a placeholder that takes on each value in the range as the loop runs. However,
  since we are not using i in the code block, it does not affect the outcome. After running this code,
  the value of number is 50, since we added 5 to it ten times. Even though the range stops
  at 9, the loop still runs ten times, since it starts counting from 0.
</p>
<p>
  We would get the same result writing "range(0,10)" or "range(1,11)." In the first case, the
  value of i would go from 0 to 9, and in the second case, it would go from 1 to 10. But in both
  cases, the loop runs ten times.
</p>
<p>
  What is useful about having a placeholder like i is that we can use it within the code block.
  This is even more useful, as we can refer to items in a list by their index. The index
  is the location of an element in the list. It starts at 0 for the first item. For example,
  in the list [2,4,6,8,10], the index of 2 is 0, the index of 4 is 1, the index of 6 is 2, and so
  on.
</p>
<p>
  To refer to an item in a list this way, we write the name of the list, followed by square
  brackets with the index inside. The notation "myList[2]" represents the element of myList
  with index 2. Remembering the index starts at zero, that would be 6.
</p>
<p>
  <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
print(myList[2])   #print the item in myList with index 2
    </input>
  </program>
</p>
<p>
This indexing is useful when combined with for loops and ranges. If we wanted to add 5
to each element in a list, we could use this indexing method. The code below does this.
</p>
<p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
for i in range(5):            #repeat the following block 5 times
    myList[i] = myList[i] + 5  #add 5 to the item in myList with index i
print(myList)
      </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
  This code starts at myList[0] and then adds 5 to it. Then, it goes ot myList[1] and adds 5 to
  it, and so on, until it has added 5 to each item in the list.
