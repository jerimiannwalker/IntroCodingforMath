  <title>For Loops</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
For loops repeat a block of code a set number of times. This is useful when we know ahead
of time how many times we want to repeat something. For loops are often used with
lists and ranges.
  </p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="lists">
  <title>Lists</title>
  <p>
    A list is a collection of thing, in a specific order. In python, we can create lists using
    square brackets, with commas between each item in the list. The following are each lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program lamguage="python">
      <input>
    <code>
      myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
    </code>
  </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    <program lamguage="python">
      <input>
    <code>
      people = [Abdul, Maria, Joseph]
    </code>
    </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    
  For loops allow us to go through each item in a list, one at a time. One way to do this
  is to name the elements of the list and use the word "in."
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
for number in myList:  #for every number in the list myList
    print(number)       #print the number
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  <p>
    This code runs through each item in "myList" and prints it one at a time. This is different
    than printing the whole list at once. As you can see below, just printing "myList" gives
    the entire list as one output.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
print(myList)   #print the whole list at once
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
  </subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ranges">
  <title>Ranges</title>
  <p>
The range function in python creates a list of numbers, in order, starting from 0 and going up to
one less than the number you give it. For example, the code below creates a list of numbers
from 0 up to 9. Notice we have to add a "list" function around the range function.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myRange = list(range(10))   #create a list from 0 to 9
print(myRange)        #print the list
      </input>
    </program>    
  </p>
  <p>
    You can start a range from any value by giving it two numbers. The first number
    is where the list will start, and the second number is where it will stop - remembering
    it will stop one before that number.
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myRange = list(range(5,15))   #create a list from 5 to 14
print(myRange)          #print the list
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>
<p>
Ranges combined with for loops allow us to repeat a block of code a set number of times. Imagine
if we wanted to take a variable "number," and add 5 to it ten times. We can do this using a range
with a for loop. Since we are not making a list, we do not need to use the list function.
</p>
<p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
number = 0
for i in range(10):       #repeat the following block 10 times
    number = number + 5   #add 5 to number
print(number)
      </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
  The variable i is a placeholder that takes on each value in the range as the loop runs. However,
  since we are not using i in the code block, it does not affect the outcome. After running this code,
  the value of number is 50, since we added 5 to it ten times. Even though the range stops
  at 9, the loop still runs ten times, since it starts counting from 0.
</p>
<p>
  We would get the same result writing "range(0,10)" or "range(1,11)." In the first case, the
  value of i would go from 0 to 9, and in the second case, it would go from 1 to 10. But in both
  cases, the loop runs ten times.
</p>
<p>
  What is useful about having a placeholder like i is that we can use it within the code block.
  This is even more useful, as we can refer to items in a list by their index. The index
  is the location of an element in the list. It starts at 0 for the first item. For example,
  in the list [2,4,6,8,10], the index of 2 is 0, the index of 4 is 1, the index of 6 is 2, and so
  on.
</p>
<p>
  To refer to an item in a list this way, we write the name of the list, followed by square
  brackets with the index inside. The notation "myList[2]" represents the element of myList
  with index 2. Remembering the index starts at zero, that would be 6.
</p>
<p>
  <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
    <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
print(myList[2])   #print the item in myList with index 2
    </input>
  </program>
</p>
<p>
This indexing is useful when combined with for loops and ranges. If we wanted to add 5
to each element in a list, we could use this indexing method. The code below does this.
</p>
<p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
myList = [2,4,6,8,10]
for i in range(5):            #repeat the following block 5 times
    myList[i] = myList[i] + 5  #add 5 to the item in myList with index i
print(myList)
      </input>
    </program>
</p>
<p>
  This code starts at myList[0] and then adds 5 to it. Then, it goes ot myList[1] and adds 5 to
  it, and so on, until it has added 5 to each item in the list.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-Counting-by-More-than-One">
  <title>Counting by More than One</title>
  <p>
    The range() function can take a third number like range(0,10,2). This third number tells the range
    what to count by. So this code would start at 0 an count by 2 up to 8 - remember the last
    number is not included!
  </p>
  <p>
    <program language="python" interactive="activecode" codelens="no">
      <input>
    myList = list(range(0,10,2)) #create a list from range
    print(myList)  #prints [0,2,4,6,8]
      </input>
    </program>
  </p>

          <p>
            You could, but don't need to, create a list here. You could use the range() function
            instead and print "as you go." Your range should start at 1 and go up to 11, since
            the last number is not included. 
          <program language="python"> 
              <input>
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
              </input>
          </program>
          </p>
        </solution>

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-2-for-loops" difficulty="medium">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Write a for loop that adds 3 to each element in the list [1,2,3,4,5] and prints 
        the new list.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        First, create the list. You can name it anything you like. Here, I call it simply "theList."
        <program language="python">
            <input>
theList = [1,2,3,4,5]
            </input>
          </program>
        Now, create a for loop that goes through each item in the list. This is where you want
        to use the indexing method. There are 5 items in the list, so you want to repeat
        the code block 5 times. You can do this using range(5).
        <program language="python">
            <input>
for i in range(5):
    theList[i] = theList[i] + 3
            </input>
            </program>
        Finally, print the new list.
        <program language="python">
            <input>
print(theList)
      </input>  
        </program>
        All together, the code looks like this:
        <program language="python">
            <input>              
theList = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in range(5):
    theList[i] = theList[i] + 3
print(theList)
        </input>
        </program>
      </p>
    </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise-3-for-loops" difficulty="hard">
      <statement>
        <p>
        Write a for loop that prints the even numbers from 0 to 20.   
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You do not need to create a list. You can use the range() function directly.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Count by 2 in the range list.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using the range() function, you can create a for loop that prints every other
          number from 0 to 20.
          <program language="python">
          <input>
for i in range(0,21,2):
    print(i)
          </input>
          </program> 
          Notice that we go up to 21. The range function stops one before the last number,
          so to include 20, we have to go one higher.
        </p>
