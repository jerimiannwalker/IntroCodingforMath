    <title> Mini Project 1</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        In this mini project, you will count the number of "5"'s in a list of numbers. Searching
        a list is a common task in programming, and counting how many times something appears
        is a good way to practice this skill. But, do know that there are all kinds of algorithms
        (step by step procedures) that can do this faster. In fact, searching algorithms is an
        entire area of computer science!

        Be sure to keep all your code in one document and comment your code well so you
        can understand what you did when you come back to it later.

    <statement>
  <p>
    The list of numbers you will be searching is given below. You can copy and paste this
    list into your code to get started.
  </p>
  <p>
    numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 5, 1, 5, 7, 9, 5, 4, 6, 5, 0, 5]
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to count, you will need to set up a variable to keep track. You will want to start
    this variable at 0 since you haven't found any "5"'s yet. Then, you will need to loop through
    each number in the list and check if it is equal to 5. If it is, you will want to add 1 to your
    counting variable. Finally, after you have checked all the numbers in the list, you will want to
    print out the value of your counting variable.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        For all of these mini projects, there are many ways to solve the problem. You may
        use different variable names, a different style with your loops, or other small things.
        Before changing all your code to match this solution, check first if you got the correct
        count! If you did, great job! If not, try to debug your code first. If you are still stuck,
        then you can look at this solution for help.

    <p>
        The correct count is 6. Here is one way to write the code to get that answer:
    </p>
    <p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
            numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 5, 1, 5, 7, 9, 5, 4, 6, 5, 0, 5]
            count = 0 #start counting at 0 outside the loop

            for number in numbers:
                if number == 5:   #check if the number is equal to 5
                    count = count + 1   #if so, add 1 to the count
            print(count)  #print the final count after the loop
            </input>
        </program>
    </p>
</solution>
